[DEMO]()

BeaMap is a offline ready mapping application to help first responders map LTE services available.

It creates a heatmap visualizing the expected network availability and quality using the link budget equation to estimate signal strength at locations.  
It accepts datasets of recorded signal strengths and improves its own estimates of the network availability.
